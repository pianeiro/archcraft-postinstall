# Archcraft Post-Installation

I'm running a series of tests with a few Linux distributions on some low-end devices I own, but I've been using Archcraft on a portable laptop for some time now.

## Objectives
In this context, this repository has a few objectives:
- The first and foremost is to record all the procedures I perform after a fresh, clean installation of Archcraft to get it ready for my use.
- In the future, however, I hope to transform it into a professional PKG package, providing a one-click approach to getting the operating system ready.

## Contributions
As you can see, this is primarily a personal project. Since it has a free license—as it should be—you are free to fork it and use it, for whatever strange reason you want to use it as a base.

You can also give me any help, suggestions, or tips, and I'll be grateful. However, keep in mind that if the change does not converge with my goals, I will politely decline the PR -- don't be sad.
